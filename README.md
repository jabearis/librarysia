The client library only uses logbooks to get the student’s information when they visit or when they borrow the books from the library. It has the possibility that the students will see the confidential information of the other students. 

# CURRENT SYSTEM FEATURES
The Library Information System will include features such as borrowing or reserving the books, checking borrowing status and checking book availability online. The users will be able to register and login to the system before they can use the features. The employees will be able to enter an admin dashboard to check users ready to pickup books to be borrowed, adding new books to the system and book inventory management.

The system will not include the organization’s human resources management, accounting, non-book inventory management and other operational and administrative tasks unrelated to book resources.
